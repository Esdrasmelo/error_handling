# Error Handling

This a small project that i am using to study **Error Handling** in **Node.js**.
There 3 endpoints:

- GET
- GET
- POST

The first GET endpoint is used to list all messages of the JSON file. The second GET endpoint is used to list one unique message using the id that is passed in the parameters of the route, and the POST endpoint is used to "create" a message, but the message is not really created, i am just doing a push on the JSON file.
